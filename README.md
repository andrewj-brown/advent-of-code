Does what it says on the tin.

- 2022: OCaml. I was working on [UQ-PAC/aslp](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/aslp) at the time. Eventually stopped because my unfamiliarity with the broader ecosystem meant I was writing a recursive descent parser every. single. day.
- 2023: C. Didn't *really* do much of it. Concocted a byte-based solution for d1 as a gag, then did d15p1 because it looked similarly easy.
- 2024: Perl. Distressingly enjoyable; my best run yet. Gave up at d12p2 because the handling of nested data structures & references... leaves a lot to be desired.
